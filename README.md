# Background

After waiting for years and passing several tests, the Martian Aerospace Agency selected you to become part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, they chose you to lead a project developing a monetary system for the new Mars colony. You decided to base this new system on blockchain technology and to define a new cryptocurrency named KaseiCoin. (Kasei means Mars in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that’s ERC-20 compliant. You’ll launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.

# In this challenge we are creating

- KaseiCoin Token Contract
- KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract
- KaseiCoin Deployer Contract
- Deploy and Test the Crowdsale on a Local Blockchain

# Technolodgies 

This project utilizes Solidity 0.5.0:
- Remix - This website acts as a workspace where you can write, compile, deploy, and interact with your solidity code.
- MetaMask - MetaMask is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications.
